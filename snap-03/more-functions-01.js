// Write a function in JavaScript that converts weights to grams. The function should take two arguments. The first argument will be a number, the second will be an abbreviation for a unit of weight, either "lbs", "oz", "kg", "g", or "mg". Based on the second argument, convert the number to grams and return it.

const convertToGrams = (weight, units) => {
    switch (units) {
        case 'lbs':
            const grams weight * 454
            break
        case
    }
}
